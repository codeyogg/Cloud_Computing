Building and Deploying a REST API on AWS using Python, PostgreSQL, and Terraform

In today's world of modern software development, building a scalable and robust REST API is crucial for businesses of all sizes. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the process of building and deploying a REST API on AWS using Python, PostgreSQL, and Terraform. We'll cover everything from setting up the database to deploying the API in a secure and scalable manner. So let's get started!

Building the API

First, we'll start by building the REST API using Python and Flask. We'll also be using SQLAlchemy to connect to a PostgreSQL database. Here are the steps:

Create a new Flask project and install the required dependencies using pip.

Define the models for movies and ratings and create the database schema using SQLAlchemy.

Implement the CRUD operations for movies and ratings using Flask.

Test the API using tools like Postman and K6 to ensure that it's functioning properly and can handle high traffic loads.

Deploying the API

Next, we'll use Terraform to deploy the API on AWS. We'll set up the required infrastructure components like VPC, subnets, security groups, ECS cluster, and Fargate service. Here are the steps:

Define the Terraform code for each resource required to deploy the API.

Configure the VPC, subnets, and security groups to ensure that the API is deployed in a secure and isolated manner.

Set up the ECS cluster and Fargate service to run the API container.

Use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store sensitive information like the database password.

Configure the load balancer and target groups to ensure that the API is accessible via HTTPS.

Configure the DNS records to point to the load balancer.

Test the deployed API using Postman and K6 to ensure that it's functioning as expected.

Configuring the API

Now that the API is deployed, we'll configure it using environment variables. We'll also use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store sensitive information like the database password. Here are the steps:

Define the environment variables required to configure the API.

Use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store the database password.

Configure the API to use the environment variables and database password from AWS Secrets Manager.

Securing the API

Next, we'll secure the API using HTTPS, SSL/TLS certificates, and the AWS Certificate Manager. We'll also set up the load balancer and target groups. Here are the steps:

Request an SSL/TLS certificate from the AWS Certificate Manager.

Configure the load balancer and target groups to use the SSL/TLS certificate.

Test the API using Postman and K6 to ensure that it's accessible via HTTPS.

Monitoring and scaling the API

Finally, we'll monitor and scale the API to ensure that it can handle high traffic loads. Here are the steps:

Monitor the API using CloudWatch.

Set up alarms and notifications for key metrics like CPU utilization, request rate, and error rate.

Set up auto-scaling for the Fargate service.

Configure the scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization and request rate.
